# Tasks

The modern society puts a lot of pressure on each one of us and task management apps could be more than just an extension to your memory.

This app remembers stuff for you so you don't have to, helps you prioritize what to work on next and makes it a stress-free process. Choose from a variety of productivity techniques to get stuff actually done. Inspired by Kanban methodology.

## The Premise

- Humans get easily overwhelmed
- Humans need to feel the progress
- Humans tend to choose the easiest task next, rather than the most important or urgent
- Humans cannot keep the focus on the current task
- Current productivity apps are good at remembering stuff for humans, they're not so great at helping humans to get stuff actually done

The goal is to provide the right set of tools for humans to get stuff actually done without feeling overwhelmed or stressed too much.

## Features

#### Prioritize with Ease

Group and sort tasks by any dimension to see what's important. The app always tries to bubble the most urgent tasks to the top.

#### Automatic Task Prioritization Based on Urgency

The app highlights the task you should pick up next to keep you focused and on track.

#### Keep Your Lives Separate

Have you ever came to work and the first task you picked was to pay the bills? Now you can keep the separate tracks of work.. well, separate. No more need to look at work-related tasks during the weekend unless you want to.

#### Where You Go You Don't Need Lists

With more lists you create more tasks go there to die and you feel like you're not moving forward. Don't put everything you can think of inside just because it might be useful in the future. It probably won't. Keep an eye on what's now.

#### Schedule Tasks for Later

Keep track of future tasks with ease and get back to them when the time comes.

#### Estimate Time Needed

Don't be overwhelmed. Estimate the time needed to complete each task to see how much actual work is on your shoulders. It might be less than you think.

#### Keep a Track of the Status

Not all tasks are actionable. Don't be distracted by those and focus on what you can actually move forward. Hide everything else.

#### Focus on Single Task with Timers

When you catch yourself procrastinating and unable to start with a big task, give it one pomodoro and you'll see.

#### Speed Up with Powerful Shortcuts

Use your keyboard to speed things up.

#### State of the Art Security

Your data is yours only. All your data in end-to-end encrypted by industry-standard AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2 algorithms. Your data in a plain form will never leave your machine. These same algorithms power password managers like 1Password or LastPass. No one has access to your data, not even me.

#### Real-time Sync and Offline Support

It's a desktop app, build to be offline-first with native feel on Mac and real-time synchronization between multiple devices.

#### Automatic Updates

Automatic updates when a new version is released. See [releases](https://github.com/mikekreeki/tasks-releases/releases) for changelog.

#### Designed For Your Mac

The desktop app is designed to run on macOS. Support for other platforms and mobile apps might be added later but the goal is to figure out and polish the best productivity workflow on macOS first.

#### Opinionated, but..

I want to equip the app with the tools I find useful for you to pick which ones work for you so you can find and customize your perfect workflow. You know yourself the best.

## FAQ

#### What's the order of tasks in the list? Can I reorder them?

There's no drag'n'drop. Having it would mean that you would need to prioritize your tasks all the time. The goal is to do the prioritization automatically based on the information available on the task itself. You can indicate perceived outside priority and the app will automatically re-sort your tasks. If two tasks have the same priority, older tasks will be on the top. This allows you to operate with steady progress, leaving no task behind. This applies to default sorting by priority/urgency, there're also other sorting options you can choose from (by estimate, by age etc.).

#### Why is one of the tasks always highlighted in bold?

This task was determined as most urgent and you should work on it next before other tasks. This guides you to operate with steady progress, leaving no task behind, and frees you from the mental overhead of deciding what to work on next all the time. Highlight the next most urgent task can be disabled in the settings.

#### How do I collapse a certain section?

Just double-click the section name.

#### How do I see the total estimate in a certain section?

Hover over section name and tooltip with the sum of estimates of all the tasks in this section will appear.

#### What is the warning icon next to Started status in the task list?

You've reached the work-in-progress limit indicating you that you have a lot of stuff in progress and probably should complete some of them before picking another task from Next. Work-in-progress limit can be disabled in the settings.

#### How do I list completed tasks?

Press `CMD+F` the same way as if you would like to search for them. The completed tasks will appear.

## Future Work

#### More Markdown
Besides links, code blocks and basic formatting let's add headings, lists, checkboxes and more Markdown magic to your task notes.

#### Integrate with Development Tools

How great would it be if all code reviews you were asked to do on Github would automatically appear in your task list? Or JIRA tickets? Trello cards? Well, it's coming.

#### Integrate Your Calendar

See your whole day schedule within the app and plot your tasks in time.

#### Extend with Public API

Automate your workflow with Public API and bring tasks from various sources into the app automagically. Is Public API too nerdy for you? Go with Zapier or IFTTT.

#### Moments, Your Personal Journal

Write down happy memories, places you visited, people you met, stuff you don't want to forget. Then take a look back at all you've accomplished and where the life took you.

#### New Productivity Techniques

I'm always on the lookout for new productivity techniques to implement. Let me know what you'd like to see and it might just get there.

## Wanna Join the Beta?

The app is early in development feature-wise, but it's pretty stable and already used by a couple of people.
